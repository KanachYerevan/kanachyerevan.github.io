If you see a tree that was recently damaged or cut down in Yerevan, you should report that to the police.
You can do that online e-request website, following these steps:

1. Open [this document template][1] in Google Docs.  Create a copy, filling in details like the number of trees, their address and exact coordinates.
2. Open the [e-request.am website][2], and file a request for the Ministry of Internal Affairs. That is the police. They should investigate the case and forward it to any other relevant authorities.  Copy the text from your Google document and insert it into the form.  
   You will have to sign in / log in to do this, which is pretty straight-forward.  
   Please check [this video tutorial][4] if you need help.
3. If you have any photos of the trees before and after the damage, please attach them to the request as well.
4. Wait for the response.  When you receive it, please share it with us via our [contact form][3], so we can keep track of these cases, and update the template if needed.

Thank you for being a voice for Yerevan's trees!
Every report adds to our collective voice. This sustained attention sends a powerful and undeniable message to city authorities: we care for our trees, and we expect them to do the same. Your action today helps create a greener Yerevan tomorrow.
