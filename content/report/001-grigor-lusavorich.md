During September 2025, work was done to replace pipes for the sewer system near 4/2 Grigor Lusavorich Street, where the Milano and Firenze Towers Residential Complex is being built.
It was noted that the root system of 9 trees were severely damaged during the excavation work, with half of the root system removed completely.
A [video][1] was recorded and [photos][2] were made by a city resident on the spot mid process, showing the damage to the trees.

On September 29, requests for investigation were sent to the Police and the Ministry of Environment.
The message was sent via [e-request.am][3], using [this template][4] in Russian language, without any digital signature.

On October 3, a response was received from the Ministry of Environment, stating that (1) an administrative case was opened, (2) an inspector together with "Kanachapatum" arborist Hazarapetyan visited the site for inspection, and (3) they concluded that the damage can only be assessed next spring, after the trees start to leaf out again, so (4) the case was set on pause.
