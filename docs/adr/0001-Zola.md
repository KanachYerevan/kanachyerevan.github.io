# ADR 0001: Adopt Zola as the Static Site Generator

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-23

## Context

Our static websites, including personal sites and the Kanach Yerevan project site, are currently built using Jekyll. While functional, the Jekyll ecosystem presents several challenges for long-term maintenance and developer experience.

The primary issues are:

1. Toolchain Complexity: Jekyll requires a specific Ruby version, managed via tools like rbenv or RVM, and dependencies are handled by Bundler. This creates a fragile setup that can be difficult to replicate across different machines and in CI/CD environments.
2. Lack of Native Multilingual Support: Jekyll does not have built-in support for multilingual sites. Achieving this requires third-party plugins (e.g., polyglot), which adds another layer of complexity and a potential point of failure during updates.
3. Theming and Customization: Modifying Jekyll themes, especially those installed as Ruby gems, can be an opaque process. Overriding specific templates or styles is often non-intuitive and poorly documented, which slows down customization.
4. Performance: As sites grow, Jekyll's build times can become noticeable, leading to a slower development feedback loop.

## Decision

We will migrate all existing static websites from Jekyll to Zola.

Zola is a modern static site generator written in Rust that addresses our current pain points:

1. Simplified Toolchain: Zola is distributed as a single, dependency-free binary. This completely eliminates the complexity of managing a Ruby environment, making local setup and CI/CD integration trivial.
2. First-Class Multilingual Support: Zola is designed with multilingual sites in mind. It provides a simple, powerful, and native way to manage translated content without relying on external plugins. This is critical for our projects which serve both English and Armenian audiences.
3. Transparent Theming: Zola themes are simply directories of files. There is no package management layer obscuring the theme's structure, making customization as simple as editing a file directly. The built-in Sass compilation also reduces configuration overhead.
4. High Performance: Being written in Rust, Zola offers near-instantaneous build times, significantly improving the development experience.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Local development setup will be drastically simplified to just downloading a single executable.
- CI/CD build processes will become faster and more reliable.
- Managing and linking translated content will be streamlined due to Zola's native i18n features.
- Customizing the look and feel of our websites will be more straightforward and faster.
- The technology stack aligns well with our existing proficiency in Rust.

Negative:

- A one-time effort will be required to migrate existing content and templates from Jekyll/Liquid to Zola/Tera.
- Any functionality dependent on specific Jekyll plugins will need to be re-implemented or handled differently in Zola.
- The ecosystem of pre-built themes for Zola, while growing, is smaller than Jekyll's.
