**Kanach Yerevan** is a social movement that aims to make Yerevan a greener, more sustainable and more livable city.
We do this by organizing mapping activities, hosting think tanks, and by raising awareness about the importance of urban greenery through public talks.

Our main product currently is the [tree mapping application](/mapping.html), field reporting, and educational materials.
