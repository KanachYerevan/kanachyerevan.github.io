With the help of volunteers, we create an open map with all trees in Yerevan.
The mapping application is optimized for mobile phones.
It can be used on the go to quickly add new trees or update existing ones with new observations.

The recommended way of using this application for volunteers is to map the trees around you and keep them up to date.
This includes places where you live, work or otherwise spend significant time.
