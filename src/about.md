**Kanach Yerevan** is a community-driven project to map and monitor the trees of Yerevan.
The project is open to everyone who wants to contribute to the preservation of the city's green heritage.
We started in April 2024, when massive tree cutting in the city center sparked public outrage.
We aim to organize the efforts of volunteers to make sure that the city's green spaces are properly maintained and expanded.

The core team consists of a group of volunteers who are passionate about trees and the environment.
Not all of us are professional arborists, but we are willing to learn and share our knowledge with others.

We have a lot to do, and we need your help.
If you are willing to participate, please join our chat in [Telegram](https://t.me/make_yerevan_green_again).
