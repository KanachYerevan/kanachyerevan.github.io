The **great tit** (Parus major) is a bird that eats a huge number of insects, which makes it a great ally in the fight against pests.
The bird has a unique talent: it can pull insect larvae out from inside the leaves, where pesticides can't reach them.
A single great tit family can eat thousands of insects in a season, effectively protecting an area with hundreds of trees.
This makes the great tit our main weapon for fighting leaf miner moths, which threaten Yerevan's oaks and chestnuts.

## The problem

While the great tit lives in Yerevan year-round, its population is scarce.
The main problem is the housing shortage, because modern urban environments lack the natural hollows these birds need to nest safely.
By providing them with simple nest boxes, we invite them to stay, raise their families, and become the diligent guardians of our city's trees.

## How you can help?

You can become a tree guardian in 3 simple steps.
Joining our project is easy and makes a real, visible impact.
Whether you're an individual, a family, or a business, you can contribute to a greener Yerevan.

- Step 1: get a nest box. You can participate in one of our community workshops, where we make them, or build one yourself. We provide [simple, proven blueprints][1] that are perfect for Great Tits while keeping competitors out.
- Step 2: install it wisely. It can be a tree, a building wall, or even a sturdy pole, as long as it's close to trees or greenery. Place it 3-6 meters high to keep it safe from predators like cats. Because Great Tits are territorial, to avoid conflicts, please install nest boxes at least 30-50 meters apart. One happy tit family is far more effective than two fighting ones.
- Step 3: put your nest box on the map. Your actions are part of a larger, city-wide effort. By adding your nest box to our public map, you help us track our growing network of natural guardians, analyze the project's effectiveness, inspire others, and maintain the nest boxes over time. Collecting this data is vital for scaling the project and demonstrating its success to the municipality.

## Join the Flock!

Every nest box installed is another small victory for our urban ecosystem.
It's a home for a bird family and a shield for our trees.

Together, we can build a living, breathing network of defense that will keep Yerevan green and healthy for generations to come.
