title: Great Tits for Yerevan
---

Yerevan's beautiful oaks and other deciduous trees are facing a persistent threat from leaf miner moths. The larvae of these insects "mine" their way through leaves, draining the tree's vitality. Year after year, this damage weakens our green giants, making them vulnerable to disease and decay.

Unfortunately, traditional pest control methods in an urban environment are often absent, expensive, or come with their own ecological side effects.

## Solution: Biological Control

Instead of chemicals, we turn to a proven, natural solution: biological control. Our chosen ally is the Great Tit (Parus major), a clever and energetic bird that lives in Yerevan year-round.

## Why the Great Tit?

* A unique skill: it's one of the very few birds capable of skillfully extracting pest larvae from inside the leaves.
* Incredible efficiency: A single titmouse family can consume thousands of insects in a season, effectively protecting an area with hundreds of trees.
* A simple need: their only challenge in the city is a housing shortage. Modern urban environments lack the natural hollows these birds need to nest safely.

By providing them with simple nest boxes, we invite them to stay, raise their families, and become the diligent guardians of our city's trees.

## How you can help?

You can become a tree guardian in 3 simple steps.
Joining our project is easy and makes a real, visible impact.
Whether you're an individual, a family, or a business, you can contribute to a greener Yerevan.

- Step 1: get a nest box. You can participate in one of our community workshops, where we make them, or build one yourself. We provide simple, proven blueprints that are perfect for Great Tits while keeping competitors out.
- Step 2: install it wisely. It can be a tree, a building wall, or even a sturdy pole, as long as it's close to trees or greenery. Place it 3-6 meters high to keep it safe from predators like cats. Because Great Tits are territorial, to avoid conflicts, please install nest boxes at least 30-50 meters apart. One happy tit family is far more effective than two fighting ones.
- Step 3: put your nest box on the map. Your actions are part of a larger, city-wide effort. By adding your nest box to our public map, you help us track our growing network of natural guardians, analyze the project's effectiveness, inspire others and maintain nest boxes in time. Collecting this data is vital for scaling the project and demonstrating its success to the municipalty.

## Join the Flock!

Every nest box installed is another small victory for our urban ecosystem.
It's a home for a bird family and a shield for our trees.

Together, we can build a living, breathing network of defense that will keep Yerevan green and healthy for generations to come.
