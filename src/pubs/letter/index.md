Based on feedback from residents, we have prepared a letter to the Mayor of Yerevan, Tigran Avinyan, regarding the management of trees in the city.  We invite you to sign it.  The letter is available in Armenian and Russian languages, you can download it from here:

Please print the file, add your signature, and send to the following address:

> 0015, Yerevan, Argishti str., 1  
> Tigran Avinyan


## Why this is needed?

Officials often say that they do not receive any negative feedback from residents on how the trees are treated.
This letter is a way to show that there are many people who care about those trees and want to see them protected.
We hope that the Mayor will take our concerns seriously and take action to change the existing approaches and protect the trees in Yerevan.

If you send the letter, please take a photo of it and send it to [our Instagram account][1].
We would love to share your support to inspire others.


## What about the responses?

Letters to officials have to be answered in a certain time frame.
If you don't want to expose your real address, you can use the address of any post office in Yerevan.
You will just have to come to the post office from time to time to check for the response, or use their mobile app.

Again, if you get a response, please [share it with us][1], no matter what it says.
