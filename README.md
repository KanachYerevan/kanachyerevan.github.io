# Kanach Yerevan website

This repository contains source files used to build the [myga.am](https://www.myga.am/) website.
The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Some other websites built with Jekyll:

- [Lineage OS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/)
- [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) is also a nice example, alas not built with Jekyll.
